The chatbot should function as follows:

1. Prompts the user with "start" , "botprompt",  and gives user with problems preset in healthCategories ( "options"), based on the language selected in the language selector.
2. The user selects one option and then the chatbot asks follow up question based on user selected option either on menstrual_health,reproductive_sexual_health, PCOS_hormonal_health, cancer_health, mental_health, or other_health
3. Once the user selects one option , the bot gets more context from the user by asking 3 questions from questionSequences.
4.The user selects option , and the bot further asks the user whether the user is interested in doctor information in nearby location or the user wants to provide answer for more questions.
5. If the user selects Doctor information , the bot prompts user with City and location where the user is
6. User selects city and should write in the chat window of his/her location
7. Based on that the bot retrives answer from backend OPENAI of nearby gynaecologists.
8. If the user has stated No, the bot gathers enough context of the user , formats the prompt and retrieves the answer from backend openAI.
8. Again bot asks user whether he wants to answer more questions, and gives him Yes/No option
9. If the user states No, bot gathers enough context of the user , formats the prompt and retrieves the answer from backend openAI
10. if user selects Yes, the bot prompts the user with more 5 questions questionSequences (3rd question onwards, as it has already asked till 3rd question)
11. The entire communication sequence and answers retrieved based on language selected from language selector.
12. The answer should be within 3-5 lines and the answer should first start with "You have so and so problem based on the context and information gathered from the user , so the recommendation is ...."
