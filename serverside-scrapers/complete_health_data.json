The last two dates I went on with two different men ended up with them trauma dumping on me.\n\nThe first guy within 20 mins of meeting him told me about his baby that died and his attempt on his own life and started crying.\n\nThe second guy also lost a young infant and started getting teary eyed during the conversation, also on the first date.\n\nI don’t want to sound heartless but I am so sick of the expectation that I be nurturing because I am a woman. These topics are not first date appropriate and I don’t know how to politely tell them they need therapy and I am not their therapist.  I don’t open up with my trauma and I expect the same going forward, what on earth do I say to these men to appropriately handle the situation? It is awkward for me and it ke",

I feel like it's incredibly fast and I'm feeling embarrassed we didn't wait longer.\n\nGoing into it, our thought was: if it happens it happens, but ideally we'd start trying after a year. We only took precaution around ovulation. However, I ovulated a few days late, so here we are. My mom also struggled with infertility so that's been a concern in my head. I thought it would take awhile... even with our risky approach. It's definitely one thing to think: Whatever happens, and another to see the positive test \n\nMost everyone I know waited a year. I can picture people saying, \"you guys wasted no time.\" We didn't, but I don't want that attention.",

I’m also in a master’s program for clinical counseling, and so I did some research about how undergoing infertility treatments affects mental health. I found several studies that show a significant increase in suicidal ideation and intent, as well as increased rates of clinical depression and anxiety. \n\nWith this in mind, I’m curious about whether any of your clinics are explicitly screening for suicidality and/or other mental health concerns. Mine definitely is not, and it seems like a major oversight. ",

Drinking daily matcha has improved my pelvic symptoms and helped stabilise my mood and hormones and I feel more energetic. It might not work for everyone but it’s just a thought for you to try if you haven’t already. I know everyone’s symptoms are so completely different but this really works for me! If you look up the health benefits it’s quite amazing. It has strong anti inflammatory properties. You can make it taste really nice with oat milk. I do iced matcha oat milk lattes!",

I am more exhausted by that effort than I have ever been by sadness or anger. It's the pretending, not the feelings. Something softened when I began to let myself be quieter, explain less, and stop trying to convince people that I was alright. I could breathe a little more easily, but nothing was magically fixed.

Some improvement with hot flashes, night sweats &amp; sleep, but I started HRT because of the chronic pain in my hips, si joints and lower back. I’ve had gluteal tendonopathy for 6 yrs, and chronic muscle guarding that won’t subside despite many treatments. I’ve been to countless specialists—including rheumatologists, and all other causes have been ruled out.  I previously exercised my whole life, now I can barely function. I went through menopause 4 years ago and felt like my body aged 30 years. Please tell me there is still hope the HRT can help!!",

Didn’t think I could take care of a baby at the time so I got an abortion. This ended up being the worst mistake of my life. Fast forward, we ended up getting married and decided we were ready for a baby. At first I was so optimistic thinking I would be about to conceive so easily because it happened out of no where last time. Well I was surely wrong. It has been officially over a year of TTC. I feel hopeless. Especially seeing everyone else around me getting pregnant. I constantly have people asking if I have kids or when I’m going to have a baby.

They know I had scans last week, so I know they’ll ask. Now I have to decide whether to lie and say I still don’t know, or tell them and ruin the party. I’m not a great liar and I’m obviously not in the most celebratory headspace.

I'm not sure how to put all I'm feeling into words or how to approach this topic. \n\nSo, I started seeing this guy and things have been going pretty good. We talked about going slow, so it's only recently started getting 'heated' which is why he's been very gentle and mindful abt not going too fast. I'm really attracted to him and I've been fantasizing abt him. In the moment, when I get turned on, I don't feel scared or sad, and would happily have sex right then and there. But then the moment passes and I don't feel 'ready' and the thought of it happening makes me feel scared and anxious.  \n\nFor context, my ex of three years cheated on me for a prolonged period of time. I don't think about him anymore, but I'm left with some feeli",

My PMDD has made it overwhelmingly worse. I've been a complete bitch this week to my boyfriend, my mood swings have been extra swingy, I'm physically and mentally exhausted, and overall feel awful.\nMy fight or flight is kicking in and I'm pondering on pulling a sicky because a Christmas Day mental breakdown is definitely pending and I don't know if I want my brother's new girlfriend to witness that 😍. Just hating the PMDD of it all rn. \nHope you're having a better time than I am and if not I hope it gets better.",

The doctors suspect one may be on my lung, neck, or hip, and I recently had an MRI done. I’ve been diagnosed with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). I'm not sure how serious it is because the doctors are still figuring it out, but I’ll have to undergo chemotherapy. All of this has happened within a year.\n\nIf you’ve had cancer after a kidney transplant, I would appreciate any advice or information you can share.

I don’t want to put that on her. \n\nOn another note, I am the kind of person who loathes sympathy from others. I’m actually dreading that more than the treatment and side effects of cancer. \n\nIf I had the ability to just “go away for awhile” to some other cancer center in another country so I could hide away and no one was",

But medication for the last 3 years of 25mcg t4 had it gone. \n\nI've also been feeling jittery shakey, my hands shake when I hold them out, havent been able to sleep, feeling hotter than usual etc",

I am also having cholesterol issues due to PCOS, so I am going no-cholesterol, and trying to aim for low carbs.

I was about two weeks out from having COVID, and my doc suggested that COVID probably caused the spike, but I’m still so anxious about it. And since chemo ended, I’ve noticed that my tummy is bigger. I have been eating a lot more lately, and could just be a normal post-hysterectomy-middle-aged-fat-redistribution pooch. But I can’t stop thinking it could be cancer. U",

Since that didn't happen, I want to make sure I put it to good use. This is my first big chunk of time off since high school and if I knew I would not be pregnant, I woul",

I used to smell awful, especially when the stress sweat was present.  \n\nWill this come back with a vengeance when my hormones get back to normal (assuming that happens but I am only 36)?

I see a lot of contradicting information on the internet. My question is about latex condoms. All sources below are either about latex condoms or condoms in general.\nOn the one hand, Healthline and Very Well Health say that you should divide the girth by 3.14 to get the width.\n\nYou can figure out the width of your penis the same way you’d determine the diameter of a circle. To do this, divide your girth measurement by 3.14. The resulting number is your width.\n\n\nTo calculate the width, divide the girth by 3.14. For example, if your penis girth is 5 inches, then the penis width would be 1.59 inches (5 inches ÷ 3.1",

What I’m noticing is a large discrepancy (around 10 days) in predicted ovulation this cycle.\n\nPremom is currently predicting ovulation around 23–24 December, while Flo (using my historical cycle lengths) is estimating around 28 December, which aligns more closely with my typical cycle pattern (mostly 31–35 day cycles, with ovulation usually occurring later).\n\nBecause I have PCOS, I experience minor LH fluctuations throughout the follicular phase, and I’m wondering whether Premom’s algorithm may be over-weighting early LH",

I thought wow, I need to poop - which is also not uncommon, I hit the laxatives pretty hard after this last round because zofran and I have an angry past. \n\nSitting on the toilet I suddenly thought no, this is worse. I mean yes I was pooping but was I nauseous too? I haven't been nauseous at all yet. Am I hungry, is this just nausea from my stomach being empty? It's like everything was bad and I couldn't pinpoint it. I felt weak. Flushed. Then hot. Then short of breath. I was starting to sweat, but I couldn't take my robe off, I heard my husband ",

I’m gonna start to trick my mind to see how it goes! I still take my Levo and other supplements but from now on, I’m gonna distract myself, bcz I won’t let it control me, let’s control it!",

I have been an egg donor in the past 2017/2018), so the stims and retrieval is not new to me. But the closer I get to starting IVF the more the fear is setting in that we won't have a baby. Our infertility is unexplained and leaning toward MFI. Our IVF will include ICSI but we won't be doing PGT. I just need some reassurance I guess. I will continue to pray.

In fact before her TSH was high and now it’s so low (at 0.02) and her T4 was low and now it’s considered high (about 4 points over) so that doesn’t seem crazy but still not in the normal “range”. \nHer antithyroglobin AB was in the 200’s before starting medication and now in the 400’s. Her dr said he wants to continue her medication at current dose &amp; said labs are satisfactory and hasn’t returned my call regarding this. So here I am on Reddit trying to get a little bit of peace of mind until I can get down to the bottom of this. \n\nAny advice? ",

But in the last few years they have mostly been missing.\n\nHowever a couple of years ago I decided I wanted to lose some weight and since nothing was working because my lack of willpower so I decided to go on a Keto diet. I've always been in a healthy weight (and was when started, just wnated to get in better shape), and did have some insulin resistance showing in a test many years ago but honestly have done nothing about it.\n\nWell, my period that had been missing for a year, returned 5 days into the diet.

I had recently had endometriosis surgery and was feeling good for the first time in a very long time. Fast forward to now, 800mg of ibuprofen just takes the edge off my pain. Oxycodone is the only thing that can take my Endo pain away but then I can't function or go to work. What was your experience? Did anything help? Does stopping the Tamoxifen or lowering the dose help? The pain is debilitating. Thanks for your insights!",

We were ecstatic and happy! So she’s been going to this cancer doctor for check ups and bloodwork to monitor her to make sure it doesn’t come back. She went for bloodwork for our daughter that’s on the way and these blood tests came back inconclusive 2 times which they now use as cancer indicator and told her to get a scan. She hasn’t had a full scan since July 2024, she went for MRI and she has 2 tumors again. One where her ovary was and now a larger one on ",

My students have pointed it out several times.

      "content": "I took a trip to Thailand and it sadly aligned with my last days of the month. My friends wanted to go into the beach and I ended up wanting to go in too but didnt want to go in using my pad. I usually dont have a heavy flow so I use the ones from Ocbon and figured those might not be good for that so my friend gave me some Tampax tampons she brought just in case and I used those. I dont know if I am being paranoid or something but I feel like my period is lasting longer than usual which is around 5 days and now I am on day 8. Could this be because of the change or becasue I went into the beach during my days?",

But it also says thyroid is mildly enlarged and mildly heterogeneous.\n\nI guess my question is, with knowing very little about the thyroid at this point… if it is mildly enlarged, doesn’t that indicate thyroiditis? I thought enlargement is thyroiditis so if it is enlarged I don’t understand how there is no thyroiditis.\n\nSide note/quesiton, why do I feel like the doctor should have ordered more blood tests than just TSH if she felt an enlarged thyroid?",

I saw someone online say \"laminate your ultrasound photos!\", and I think it's safe to say they left out a key detail about the method of laminating. \n\nAlso, take a photo of your ultrasound photos with your phone; that way, if you ruin or lose the original, you have that digital copy. 💗",

I am 30F and was suffering from autoimmune diseases: mild arthritis and also with severe scalp psoriasis, but currently in remission after putting much effort into changing my diet and taking ayurvedic herbal supplements, along with probiotics etc. I think my remission was a result of these two. I followed a strict keto/dairy free diet for about 6 months, along with herbal supplements for 5 months, which led to remission.\n\nI feel so happy, and I see many of you struggling. I wonder if you‘ve tried any of the above, and if no, then why not? What‘s holding you back, especially in changing your diets?\n\nI am Indian and believe in the ayurvedic medicinal system and how it literally changed my life, especially in curing the mild arthritis pain.

After reading about PME a little, now I'm not sure PMDD is the right diagnosis for me. The reason being that I'm always depressed and anxious and it gets worse before my period, and gets better once my period starts. I'm also on birth control (Sprintec), so I figured that would help the symptoms, but I don't think it does. Should I talk to my regular doctor about this, or my psychologist? Or should I not really bother since I'm already managing my depression with antidepressants?",

I am 34F, 5’5” and 149 lbs. I like to weight train. My thyroid levels are all perfect. I’ve been on the same dose 25mcg of levothyroxin since I was 18.

I just feel like it’s too soon and I would like to know the extent of everything before making such a big life decision. \n\nI don’t have kids and I don’t know if I do but when the option is taken off the table it sets in a lot of anxiety and dread.

As a kid I could fantasise really clear pictures and I daydreamed constant fluid scenes but as I got older that ability started fading away and now I’m stuck with distorted close to empty images in my head. As an artist this makes me extremely frustrated because I can’t draw anything without using references or inspiration for every limb and haven’t properly drawn for maybe 2 ish years now that it started to become more severe, does anyone know what it is?

I’m dealing with a rough night of anxiety and insomnia and could use some grounding perspectives.\n\nWhen I try to sleep, my anxiety ramps up and I start feeling disconnected and unreal. My thoughts spiral into worrying about not sleeping and what that might mean for my health, which only keeps me awake more.\n\nI’m just exhausted and scared of the cycle itself. I’ve had anxiety before, but nights like this make it feel much more intense.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with anxiety-induced insomnia or derealization and found ways to ride it out without fighting it, I’d appreciate hearing what helped you get through nights like this.\n\nThanks.\n",

For clarity I’m m20 and every time I would go I would get the same response “you seem perfectly healthy” and they would check my blood pressure and do physical tests like checking how strong my grip was and balance tests. But every time I would leave this same response. Whilst this was going on my health anxiety was getting worse and worse to a point the head pressure felt like it was the only thing my mind",

The progestogens are the type of hormone that is mainly responsible for the contraceptive effects.

The estrogen was only added to the formulation by chance. As the pill was developed, John Rock experimented with norethynodrel, developed by Frank Colton in 1952. The daily dose of 10 mg effectively suppressed ovulation in all women, and no breakthrough bleeding occurred. Due to these encouraging results, Rock wanted to further purify the norethyno",

I just don’t have the financial ability to be off work for more than a week-ish and also I live in a two story townhouse. I’ve had two c-sections and a laparoscopy and I know what surgical recovery feels like. It was so difficult to do anything. I just don’t think I can do it. At least when I have my pain now I can still move or it passes and then I’m able to move. There’s no incisions and stitches and healing muscles. I’d love to live pain free, but until I don’t have to worry about caring for my kids and can financially handle a percentage of my pay",

      "content": "So i started getting a pain just over 2 days ago and its located at the bottom of my stomach just at my right where my ovaries are. The pain isnt unbearable it just feels like its a period cramp but only at that side. It hasnt gone away at all and i tried taking pain relief but the pain is still there. Tried with a hot water bottle but it doesnt help either. Im not due my period for another 2 weeks so i was unsure if its ovulation pain but i dont usually get that. Is this anything i need to worry about or does anyone have a clue on what it could be? I usually overthink a lot of things so im trying not to worry. \n\nThanks",

I don’t have a normal period and haven’t since I was assaulted 4 years ago - I had no period for 2 years after the assault and in the last 2 years have switched to spotting most days. Ive been using an Oura ring to try to track my bleeding for about 9 months and it has only detected one ovulation in that time. so my cycle is normally messed up. ",

You can have symptoms of thyroid issues when this happens despite having normal thyroid levels.  I do not have a problem with starting a low-dose thyroid medication to see if this helps.  Will have to recheck your level in a TSH in 12 weeks.  The risk is that putting you into a hyperthyroid meaning overactive thyroid which can be dangerous for you, it is a delicate balance.

In July my TSH was a bit over 3, but back in 2021 (also a period of time when I felt worse than normal) it was 4.4.

They said some girls look older at that age and its fine then.\nI don't think that's true as science has shown very young pregnancies are harmful. Someone replied if a 9 year old has a 15 year old body they are biologically older and its not harmful.\nAre there hard facts showing very young pregnancies are harmful?\n",

      "content": "Good evening reddit. This is a bit of an embarrassing \n\nWhen it comes to self care and self pleasure, I would like to make it more fulfilling and special. I am demisexual, so I don't really feel sexy without a big emotional component, and there's nothing I have that strong emotional attachment for. Unfortunately, I don't have a very good imagination, and when I try to use my imagination, thinking that hard sort of takes me out of the sexy mood. Is there any tips for making things more fulfilling?\n\nAlso, I never really learned how, mechanically, to do it right. So if there are any tips for that, I would appreciate it as well. I use a massager, and that works, but I have a feeling I am doing it wrong because I have a hard time maintaining the \"this feels amazing\" motions.\n\nThank you for any ",

I can feel a pass out coming on.  It is not like \" oh, I'm getting sleepy, I need a nap. \"  I will put down my device and lay down and within minutes I am out.   I don't know if my brain is shutting down or what. I wil talk to my Dr. next visit.\nI just wondered if anyone else has had anything like this happen?

Because my parents didnt really care for/notice my mental health issues, I was stuck in a routine of: Wake up at mid day, play video games on my pc till 3am, go to sleep, repeat. That continued until this year when, about 4~ish months ago I came back to high-school. Im about to turn 17 now, and I honestly have no memories of anything from before this year. It feels like I literally went through a time skip and appeared here, where I did nothing in my education, didnt grow as a person, and didnt make any memories. How am I ever meant to move on with the overwhelming feeling that I 'missed everything', and will never be able to get it back?",

Whether that be via in vitro fertilization (IVF) or surrogacy? \n\nI imagine that the process of freezing-eggs is different depending on what country you live, your insurance, etc. But I have a few questions: \n\n1: What is the general method of extracting the egg from the ovary? \n\n2: How long can the eggs be frozen to be viable for possible fertilization? \n\n3: Is it better to freeze your eggs younger, rather than older, if you're not ready to start a family just yet? \n\n4: I know this answer will vary drastically, but what is a ballpark estimate of how much ",

      "content": "The effectiveness of contraception methods is typically reported as two percentages: typical use and perfect use.\n\nTypical use is the measure of how the average couple is likely to use the method, and takes into account incorrect or inadequate application. For example: an inside-out condom, or a missed day of birth control pills.\n\nPerfect use assumes the couples being studies used the contraceptive method exactly as directed, without errors.\n\nHow are participants partitioned into these two groups?\n\nIs there typically one large study, and participants self-report if they did not meet perfect use?\n\nAre two groups formed prior to the study's start, and given differing levels of instruction?\n\nOr something else?\n",

The other day,  a doctor was looking over my meds and for what purpose I take them for, and said, \"I assume you're taking Spironolactone for your PCOS, yeah?\" I told him it was for my adult acne, but I do in fact have PCOS. He was surprised I wasn't taking it for PCOS. I've never heard of Spironolactone being used for PCOS... and now I'm curious: \n\nHow does the med, Spironolactone, help with PCOS?  \n\nWould the Spironolactone I'm taking for acne also be helping my PCOS, and I just never knew about it?

      "content": "Around two or three days ago I noticed some unusual dry red patches started forming on my face. They're dry, rather itchy, and red even though some aren't that red. As of now, I have them under my eyes near my cheekbones, the sides of my face and the area around my jaw. At first I assume this happens because I'm near my menstrual cycle (I'm currently seventeen years old), however this never happens before. I tried Googling and the symptoms are most similar to eczema, but I'm not that sure. I've been layering on moisturizer to soothe it but nothing happens. What am I supposed to do to heal/reduce these dry patches and what causes it? Thank you. \n",

The doctor told us to be cautiously optimistic, but they don’t like seeing anything under 90-100 right now. \n\nWell, in the same breath….we just got over a really bad flu (or something like that?) a few days ago, and now pregnancy symptoms are getting much stronger. Is it possible that the flu put so much stress on the body that now the babies heartbeat is just starting to ramp up a bit behind schedule?

If you dont get good marks, people look down upon you. My parents are chill but it's the outside pressure. And also the lack of contact with the opposite gender. In my country, society judges you for spending time with the opposite gender. They consider it a waste of time, and you get slammed for it. And moral policing is so common, that you fear for your self. Can't have a gf, and if you do have one, you can't spend quality time together. Peo",

It's on early gestiation, late, or both?\nWe are gathering information to know if we must go full nuclear and isolate ourselves completely during christmas, or if we don't really risk much gathering (only unmasking during meals). We are sure everyone coming is vaccinated.\nAre there other even greater risks for the fetus, related to the mother becoming infected with covid-19?\n",

It would seem then that given conception can either fail before, during, or after the fertilization phase (there is no fourth option), there are only two logical causes of failure to conceive, failure to fertilize (before/during) and failure of the zygote post-fertilization (after). Which of these two options is dominant in typical failure to conceive? Asked another way, statistically speaking (as of course every case is different), for couples struggling to conceive, is the issue generally that the egg does not fertilize, or that the egg does fertilize but fails to develop, akin to a very early miscarriage?\n",

In October, got my levels rechecked (TSH 1.3 free t4 1.41) and my dr called and said that I could stop synthroid if I wanted- I declined but ended up switching to generic levo bc it was cheaper.

I needed peace, distance, and time to recalibrate my brain.\n\nOver the past year though, I slowly started talking to people again—very casually, very frank, and honestly, it felt nice. Like I was finally easing back into being human.\n\nThen around three months ago, this guy texted me. We talked briefly. And now I can’t stop thinking about him.\n\nHe was… *my type*. Like genuinely.

The panel explored why menopause is rarely represented on screen—and when it is, why it’s often treated as a punchline.

The panelists shared insights and best practices for reframing outdated stereotypes and redefining how women’s midlife stories are told on screen. We are excited to see how this shapes new screen stories and depictions of women's lives!Learn more a",
